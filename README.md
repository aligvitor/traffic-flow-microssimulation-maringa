This project considers traffic volume data of an intersection in the city of Maringá, state of Paraná, Brazil, and performs a microsimulation (with Eclipse Sumo) in order to quantitatively analyze the performance of the intersection considering traffic delay and vehicle emissions. Afterwards, a dashboard is created comparing the results of both softwares.
